Example project to try out Powermock and Mockito

I have tried this example
https://examples.javacodegeeks.com/core-java/mockito/powermock-mockito-integration-example/

A little note: i tried this example with newer versions of 
powermock-api-mockito / mockito-core / powermock-module-junit4.
the JUnit4 tests failed however...i downgraded to these versions (see Gradle file) and now it works. 
So keep in mind that if you want to run these JUnit tests run it with these versions.
